## About This Project

Life Duel is an experimental journey exploring the limits of Large Language Models in game development. The goal is ambitious: create 100 games, each as a self-contained HTML file, learning something new from every implementation.

This project is a father-son collaboration documenting the future of human-AI collaboration in software development, one HTML file at a time. Every game tells a story of experimentation, learning, and discovery.

**Current Progress:** 18/100 games completed
